# NeuralNetworkWithKeras

## Description
This notebook explores neural networks and deep learning concepts using TensorFlow and Keras.   This notebook consists of the following: 

- Preprocessing data for a neural network model.
- Using the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.
- Optimization of the neural network model. 


## Technologies

This example uses the following technologies:

- **Jupyter** - Jupyter is a web-based interactive development environment for data science and analysis. Please see [Jupyter documentation](https://jupyter.org/) for more information.
- **pandas** - pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. Please see [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for more information.
- **Scikit-Learn** - Scikit-Learn is an open-source machine learning library for the Python programming language.  Please see [Scikit-Learn documentation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scikit_learn/scikit_learn_introduction.htm) for more information.
- **Google Colab** - Google Colab allows you to write and execute Python code in the browser without installing dependencies
- **TensorFlow** - End-to-end open-source platform for machine learning
- **Keras** - Abstraction layer on top of TensorFlow that makes it easier to build models 

## Installation

Since we are using MAC OSX with an M1 chip, we will not install TensorFlow and Keras.   This is because the M1 chip is currently not compatible with the TensorFlow.   Instead, we will run this notebook within Google Colab. 



## Usage

### Launching the Notebook

To launch the Notebook, perform the following steps:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Navigate to the location of the Notebook.
3. Enter `jupyter lab` at the Terminal prompt.
4. Verify that you can access Jupyter in your browser.

Once you have launched the notebook, you can then execute each section.

1. Preprocessing data for a neural network model.
2. Using the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.
3. Optimization of the neural network model.
